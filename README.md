# Data Visualization of the "Transfer Market" in the College Basketball World
In recent years, there is an ongoing trend that more coaches are into the “transfer market” in the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball world. The motivation behind this phenomenon is based on the assumption that a transfer player is more seasoned than an average high school recruit. Coaches recruit such a type of players with an anticipation that the latter will give their teams an immediate boost.

This data visualization project attempts to analyze how players performed after they transferred to a new school. In addition, this work also serves as a foundation for a modeling project that attempts to estimate how certain players would project at certain levels in the future.
